# Reporting of CVEs and Security Issues

## The A2A Java SDK community takes security bugs very seriously

We aim to take immediate action to address serious security-related problems that involve our project.

Note that we will only fix such issues in the most recent minor release of the A2A Java SDK.

## Reporting of Security Issues

When reporting a security vulnerability it is important to not accidentally broadcast to the world that
the issue exists, as this makes it easier for people to exploit it. The software industry uses the term
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/security-embargoes-red-hat">embargo</a> to describe the time a
security issue is known internally until it is public knowledge.

Our preferred way of reporting security issues is listed below.

### Email the A2A Java SDK team

To report a security issue, please email <a href="mailto:fjuma@redhat.com">fjuma@redhat.com</a>,
<a href="mailto:kkhan@redhat.com">kkhan@redhat.com</a>, and/or <a href="mailto:smaestri@redhat.com">smaestri@redhat.com</a>. A member of the team will open the required issues.

### Other considerations

If you would like to work with us on a fix for the security vulnerability, please include your GitHub username
in the above email, and we will provide you access to a temporary private fork where we can collaborate on a
fix without it being disclosed publicly, **including in your own publicly visible git repository**.

Do not open a public issue, send a pull request, or disclose any information about the suspected vulnerability
publicly, **including in your own publicly visible git repository**. If you discover any publicly disclosed
security vulnerabilities, please notify us immediately through the emails listed in the section above.
